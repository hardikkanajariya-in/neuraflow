    {
      "question": "What is NeuraFlow and how does it work?",
      "answer": "NeuraFlow is an AI-powered workflow automation platform that lets you design, deploy, and monitor intelligent automation pipelines. You connect your tools, define triggers and conditions, and our AI engine handles task execution, routing, and error recovery automatically."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need coding experience to use NeuraFlow?",
      "answer": "Not at all. Our visual workflow builder uses a drag-and-drop interface that anyone can use. For advanced users, we also support custom code steps in Python and JavaScript, but they're entirely optional."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does NeuraFlow's AI decision engine differ from simple if/else logic?",
      "answer": "Traditional automation tools use static rules. NeuraFlow's AI engine learns from your workflow patterns, understands context from previous runs, and makes intelligent routing decisions. It can handle ambiguous inputs, detect anomalies, and adapt its behavior over time."
    },
    {
      "question": "What integrations does NeuraFlow support?",
      "answer": "We offer 200+ native integrations covering CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot), databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB), cloud services (AWS, GCP, Azure), communication tools (Slack, Teams, Email), and many more. Any service with an API can be connected via our custom webhook integration."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is my data secure with NeuraFlow?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. We are SOC 2 Type II certified with end-to-end AES-256 encryption for data at rest and TLS 1.3 for data in transit. We support role-based access controls, IP allowlisting, and comprehensive audit logging. Enterprise customers can choose their data region."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I self-host NeuraFlow?",
      "answer": "Our Enterprise plan includes an on-premise deployment option. You get the same powerful platform running entirely within your own infrastructure, with full control over data residency and network configuration."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if a workflow run fails?",
      "answer": "NeuraFlow includes automatic retry logic with configurable backoff strategies. Failed runs are logged with detailed error context, and you can set up alerts via email, Slack, or webhooks. The AI engine also suggests fixes based on the error pattern."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does pricing work for overages?",
      "answer": "If you exceed your plan's monthly run limit, additional runs are billed at a per-run rate (visible on your billing page). We send alerts at 80% and 95% usage so you're never surprised. You can also set hard caps to prevent overages entirely."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I migrate from another automation tool?",
      "answer": "Yes. We provide migration guides for Zapier, Make (Integromat), n8n, and other popular platforms. Our support team can assist with complex migration projects. Most customers are fully migrated within a week."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is there a free tier available?",
      "answer": "Yes! Our Starter plan is completely free and includes up to 5 active workflows with 1,000 runs per month. It's a great way to evaluate NeuraFlow before committing to a paid plan. No credit card required."
